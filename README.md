Bookmark App

As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title url link description rating (1-5) I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.

I can click on a See More button to display the "expanded" view.

Expanded view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list from the "expanded" view with a delete button.

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required) I can select from a dropdown (a element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
